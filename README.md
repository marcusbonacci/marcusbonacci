Languages I want to learn:
- Java
- Python
- Rust

Other things I want to learn:
- Distributed Systems
  - Docker (Compose, CLI, Desktop)
  - Kubernetes
- Databases
  - SQL & NoSQL
  - TimeSeries (Influx DB)

What I've done:
- Distributed Systems with minecraft
  - Summary: Created a docker network and containerized Minecraft with a proxy. Created a Java/Kotlin program to push data from servers to InfluxDB, and monitor it with Grafana.
  - Future improvements: Push to Kubernetes and create a service to scale the network automatically. Maybe setup a docker level monitoring solution?
